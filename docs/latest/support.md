Be sure to be as detailed as possible about exactly what you were doing when the issue occured and how we can reproduce it.


Nikita: should we refer developers to this: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Custom-Visuals-Development/bd-p/CustomVisualsDevelopmentDiscussion ? (*)
we cannt control where developers post discussions but as we agreed we will refer them to (*) but your team will check both. is it reasonable for you?
